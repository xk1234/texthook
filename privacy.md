# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** May 12, 2025

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the Rewrite app ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards your information. By using the app, you agree to the practices described below.

## 1. Information We Collect

- **Text You Provide:**
  - Original input text entered on the Rewrite screen.
  - Rewritten output returned by our backend service.

- **Local Storage:**
  - Projects (original and rewritten texts) are saved locally on your device using AsyncStorage. No data is uploaded off-device unless you explicitly choose to share.

- **Usage Data (Anonymized):**
  - Aggregate metrics such as number of rewrites, error counts, and response times to help us improve performance. This data does not include any of your actual text.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

- **Provide the Rewrite Service.** We forward your input text to third‑party AI services (OpenRouter AI, ZeroGPT, GPT‑4o) to generate and verify paraphrases, then return only the transformed output.
- **Local Persistence.** We store your projects on your device so you can view, copy, or delete them at any time.
- **App Improvements.** Aggregated, anonymized usage data helps us diagnose issues and enhance the user experience.

## 3. Third‑Party Services

When you request a rewrite, we share your text with:

- **OpenRouter AI** for paraphrasing (model: `google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001`).
- **ZeroGPT** for AI‑detection scoring.
- **OpenAI GPT‑4o** for paragraph formatting.

These services process your text momentarily and return only the rewritten text. We do not retain copies on our servers beyond the minimal runtime needed to fulfill your request.

## 4. Data Security

- **In‑Transit Protection:** All API calls are made over HTTPS.
- **Local Storage:** Your projects are stored only on your device. We do not sync or back them up to external servers.
- **No Personal Accounts:** We do not collect personal identifiers (emails, names, phone numbers).

## 5. Children’s Privacy

Our app is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If you believe we have inadvertently done so, please contact us to have the data deleted.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When material changes occur, we will update the "Last updated" date and, if appropriate, notify you via an in‑app notice.
